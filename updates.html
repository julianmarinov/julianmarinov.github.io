            The last couple of days I've been learning how Bootstrap works and actually started working on the
            Flashgate ltd. website conversion from WordPress to a custom-made website. I finished the structure,
            content and design of the home page. I played a lot with all the settings, and it's amazing how intuitive
            is the process of making a website responsive using Bootstrap. It's easy to test and adjust the
            responsiveness of each element. It would take a lot of time to build a complete website like that, but once
            I have the structure for the repetitive pages (for example for each service) I think it should get easier.
            What's left is to optimize the code, then to work on the SEO aspect of the page and finally a separation
            of the navigation and footer using JavaScript in order to be able to modify them independantly and globally.
            I am pretty hyped! How much more could I do when I get to the DOM manipulation with JavaScript? It would be
            a lot of fun!

            After finishing my 10-problems-solved-per-day commitment, I started looking into <b>Bootstrap</b>.
            I don't necessarily want to do all my CSS just to be able to say that "I did it all". Sometimes
            cost is as important as the quality of the work, so I'd soon begin my experiments with <b>Bootstrap</b>.
            At first, I planned to use it on this website, but then I realized that a better way to implement it
            would be on a different project that I don't care about so much. However, it must make sense to me at least.
            I might just try to recreate my company website - <a href="https://flashgate.co" target="_blank">
            Flashgate Ltd.</a> which needs some refreshing, and it's mostly just an information-based website.
            The current design is not bad, but it is missing some uniformity. Also, I am not happy with it's
            loading speed. It would be a productive little project that would definitely take way more time to finish
            than what I expect right now.

            I've been away from the matter for few months. When I tried to get some work done, I realized that
            there is nothing in my head. I understand something people frequently say about learning <b>software
            development</b> - It's way better to spend 20 minutes a day doing some small tasks rather than working
            few consecutive days 5-6 hours. When time passes, nothing stays in your mind. However, in just few days
            I almost recovered all that seemed lost. And it didn't work by just watching a course from the beginning.
            It worked when I started solving simple problems with the most basic JavaScript operators. I got faster
            and faster, then I jumped to more difficult tasks ad was actually easy. So my conclusion is: If you want
            to learn - solve problems. If you want to refresh your knowledge - solve problems. If you want to acheave
            anything big - <b>just solve problems. One after another.</b>

            Today I decided to get familiar with the only part of <b>JavaScript</b> I've never got into - the DOM
            manipulation. I get the idea and seems very interesting, but because I still feel unsecure about <b>CSS</b>
            selectors and classes, I decided to wait few more days. I prefer the slow but steady pace instead of the
            quick pass of each subject. So I will keep improving the visual part of this website with <b>CSS</b> and
            I will also add more <b>HTML</b> elements, just to play with all I can think about.
            Yesterday I finished the visual aspect of the "Contact" page. I created a form using <b>HTML</b> and
            also gave it a nice styiling with <b>CSS</b>. Every time I do something I feel like I can't quite
            remember some <b>CSS</b> properties and this is why I need more practice.

            I left behind the interactive learning methods of the modern web schools and went back to the good old
            books to learn the basics of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. After repeating like a chimp
            step-by-step what the online courses tryid to teach me, I realized that my mind doesn't work that way.
            I need a slow but steady pace in order to internalize all the content. As fast as I go, as little I learn!
            This is why I went right back to the basics. If I am not capable of building a beutifull website using
            just <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, thinking that <b>JavaScript</b> would help me is the wrong way to go.
            So if you are interested in following my development journey, just come back in a few days!
