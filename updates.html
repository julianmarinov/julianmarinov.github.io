            I've been away from the matter for few months. When I tried to get some work done, I realized that
            there is nothing in my head. I understand something people frequently say about learning software
            development - It's way better to spend 20 minutes a day doing some small tasks rather than working
            few consecutive days 5-6 hours. When time passes, nothing stays in your mind. However, in just few days
            I almost recovered all that seemed lost. And it didn't work by just watching a course from the beginning.
            It worked when I started solving simple problems with the most basic JavaScript operators. I got faster
            and faster, then I jumped to more difficult tasks ad was actually easy. So my conclusion is: If you want
            to learn - solve problems. If you want to refresh your knowledge - solve problems. If you want to acheave
            anything big - just solve problems. One after another.

            Today I decided to get familiar with the only part of JavaScript I've never got into - the DOM
            manipulation. I get the idea and seems very interesting, but because I still feel unsecure about CSS
            selectors and classes, I decided to wait few more days. I prefer the slow but steady pace instead of the
            quick pass of each subject. So I will keep improving the visual part of this website with CSS and I will
            also add more HTML element, just to play with all I can think about.
            Yesterday I finished the visual aspect of the "Contact" page. I created a form using HTML and also gave it
            a nice styiling with CSS. Every time I do something I feel like I can't quite remember some CSS properties
            and this is why I need more practice.

            I left behind the interactive learning methods of the modern web schools and went back to the good old
            books to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After repeating like a chimp step-by-step what
            the online courses tryid to teach me, I realized that my mind doesn't work that way. I need a slow but
            steady pace in order to internalize all the content. As fast as I go, as little I learn! This is why I
            went right back to the basics. If I am not capable of building a beutifull website using just HTML and
            CSS, thinking that JavaScript would help me is the wrong way to go. So if you are interested in
            following my development journey, just come back in a few days!
