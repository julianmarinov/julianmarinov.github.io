            Today I decided to get familiar with the only part of JavaScript I've never got into - the DOM
            manipulation. I get the idea and seems very interesting, but because I still feel unsecure about CSS
            selectors and classes, I decided to wait few more days. I prefer the slow but steady pace instead of the
            quick pass of each subject. So I will keep improving the visual part of this website with CSS and I will
            also add more HTML element, just to play with all I can think about.
            Yesterday I finished the visual aspect of the "Contact" page. I created a form using HTML and also gave it
            a nice styiling with CSS. Every time I do something I feel like I can't quite remember some CSS properties
            and this is why I need more practice.

            I left behind the interactive learning methods of the modern web schools and went back to the good old
            books to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After repeating like a chimp step-by-step what
            the online courses tryid to teach me, I realized that my mind doesn't work that way. I need a slow but
            steady pace in order to internalize all the content. As fast as I go, as little I learn! This is why I
            went right back to the basics. If I am not capable of building a beutifull website using just HTML and
            CSS, thinking that JavaScript would help me is the wrong way to go. So if you are interested in
            following my development journey, just come back in a few days!
